# SMDGraphs

_A simple, light, and flexible API for graph-like data structure handling._

The purpose of SMDGraphs.jl is to enable efficient support for graph operations and analysis 
on custom user-defined datatypes. It achieves so by offering a set of light-weight wrappers 
around [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl). 

## Installation 
This package can be installed using Julia's package manager:
